      <section><h1>5 Ways To Improve Your Mental Health</h1> <i>By Muhammad Abban</i> <br><br><br></section>
      Our mental health is just as <a href="{tal's article}">important</a> as our physical health. Not only is it necessary for our survival, it has numerous benefits too - more positive energy and mood, better performance in your daily activities, and better thinking to name a few.
      <br><br>
      So how can you actually avail these perks? Here are 5 practises that you can adopt to improve your mental health.
      <hr>
      <b>Reading</b>
      The mind is an ocean, with its capacity beyond our comprehension. Reading allows you to surf its endless waves, and explore its hidden depths. Who knows what treasure you may find?
      <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-reading-books">Studies</a> have found a plethora of potential gems that you could unearth during reading, even longer life. It is however naturally hard for most of us to read. We usually associate reading negatively with schoolwork. You will be surprised to know that reading is much more than that, and that even adults read. That latest blockbuster you really liked? Probably was the recreation of a book’s story. There’s also no restrictions on what you can read. Adults might tell you against reading graphic or romance novels, but if your book of interest is made of paper and has decent cover art, you should definitely read it ;)
      <br><br>
      <b>Exercising</b>
      I’ll save you the ordeal of listening to the most cliche talk ever - about how much your physical health matters, and that you should exercise regularly. Uncle Talk! One thing you may not have heard of, however, is how much exercise helps you improve your mental health. Doctors recommend it to people dealing with stress, and strenuous activity releases a neurotransmitter, serotonin, that gives us our <a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/exercise-fitness/stress">“happy” moods</a>. Physical exercise also gives people satisfaction, and it can be fun too. Exercise can really brighten up your mood, so give it a try!
      <br><br>
      <b>Going for a walk</b>
      If you don’t like the idea of working your body out and getting tired, then you should try going for a walk. It allows you to get away from your mobile phone and take in some fresh air. Seeing the light of day every now and then will prevent you from becoming a vampire! You can also meet people during walks and, speaking from experience, even make new friends. You’ll also become more informed of the community around you, and be play some role in contributing to it. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Meditation</b>
      Oh no! The pinnacle of boredom. How could just sitting around in absolute silence, while doing nothing possibly enlighten my mood? Well it doesn't have to be that. 
      <br>
      Firstly, meditating requires a lot of concentration, so you’ll have plenty to do while focusing on your breathing. Secondly, meditation doesn't have to be done in <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-practice-music-meditation-3144791">unnerving silence</a>. You can try focusing on calm instrumental music too. All of this may still not make meditation very alluring to you, and that's alright. Not all of these tips are meant for you, but I really suggest trying a few out and seeing what works for you.
      <br><br>
      <b>Talk to people</b>
      Last but not least, is simply talking to people. Whether that’s casual small talk or about something that’s troubling you, talking to people can help you <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/your-mental-health/looking-after-your-mental-health/talk-about-your-feelings">relieve stress</a>. No one’s perfect and everyone goes through tough times, so it's completely fine to share some personal thoughts with your friends, or at the minimum, your family. Talks don't always have to be serious either. Just discussing a sports game from yesterday or having some light-hearted jests can easily cheer up a person’s mood.
      <br><br>
      That wraps up my tips to you for improving your mental health. There is no guarantee to whether you’ll actually enjoy any of them, but you won't know until you try. If you do try any, we’d love some feedback at <a href="mailto:ATM.sr.health@gmail.com">ATM.sr.health@gmail.com</a> :)
