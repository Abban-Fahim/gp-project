      <section><h1>Rising Derelict Mental health in Teenagers</h1> <i>By Talha Ijaz</i> <br><hr><br></section>
      Adolescence is one of the most crucial transitional stages in a teen’s life, as well the most vulnerable one, as influences experienced during the transition shapes the maturity of teen in its adulthood. Whilst also inducing mental health issues that deem detrimental to oneself’s well-being and stepping responsibilities in later life. <br><br>
      Nowadays, inimical issues such as depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, stress and adverse behvaioral changes are neglected severely by today’s teens, standing as some of the most significant atrocities in their mental stabitlity. As physical health is given more importance over mental health, it unfortunately isn’t something uncommon in teens. These issues take forms into the maturing of teens and their long-term mental health, which severely impacts not only stressful decision-making, but carrying out tasks in daily life as well, which may very well scar the adulthood of the growing population. <br><br>
      Notably, the issues have accentuated more in the COVID-19 pandemic, which globally restricted social contact. Causing elongated and unrestrained time spent on devices and away from a healthy social life, into the toxicity of online social media which reached its peak in the pandemic. As of now, the worst of the media’s toxicity culminated in the pandemic, ergo, exposure to the already vulnerable adolescents, spoiling mental health. Whilst distancing from healthier social lives, it has proliferated social atomization at numbers which doesn’t make it an uncommon issue anymore. Typically, due to social anxiety or other mental health issues, in which teens avoid having social contacts with others around. Social isolation causes difficulty in sleeping, lack of self-esteem, inability to handle tough situations, loneliness, depression and anxiety and disorderly conduct. <br><br>
      The stage of adolescence is essential for teens. Though its pernicious consequences which for the time being heavily affects teens and influences their future life, the transition’s challenges are one of the hardest teens will ever experience in their lives, and is rather a ‘test’ for them. These ‘tests’ is what matures a teen, which gives a glimpse to the midst of bigger challenges in other forms they will face later on. Nevertheless, mental health is a concern that should be forsaken at no costs, or have your blissed prospects indebted. <br><br>
