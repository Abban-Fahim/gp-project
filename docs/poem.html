        Get up, you slacker<br />
        Another day is yet to be wasted,<br />
        Just like every yesterday,<br />
        You chose to sit out.<br />
        <br />
        The world beneath your idle feet,<br />
        Dictates for bliss to be achieved.<br />
        Fitness was the antidote,<br />
        To your fraught affliction.<br />
        <br />
        You read about triumph,<br />
        Groundbreakers and prodigies.<br />
        Did they not put in toil and effort?<br />
        To achieve what you only conceive.<br />
        <br />
        A shadow of ennui,<br />
        Awning over your indolent mind,<br />
        Left you inert,<br />
        And numbed your interests.<br />
        <br />
        Won't it be elating,<br />
        If you relish in your pastimes,<br />
        Rather than atrophy,<br />
        As your time withers away.<br />
        <br />
        Solution to boredom,<br />
        Solution to grief.<br />
        What did you get,<br />
        From that extra hour of sleep.<br />
